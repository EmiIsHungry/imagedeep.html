    <h1> Emily's Deep Image</h1>
    <img src="deep.jpg" alt ="Chair with shine" /> 
    <p> I chose this photo because I want something different to be in my projects and I wanted the camera to focus on the background and the chair. I chose this setup because I feel like how the chair is angle make it look good and it was showing sharp background and object. </p>
